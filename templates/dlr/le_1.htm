			Low down-payment: a 24-month Red Carpet Lease means a lower down payment
			and less money up front than with a conventional loan.

			More vehicle for the money: because leasing dollars go further than purchase
			dollars, a 24-month Red Carpet Lease means you can drive more vehicle for
			the same amount of money.
		<P>
			A new vehicle every two years: with a Ford Credit 24-month Red Carpet Lease,
			you can drive a new vehicle every two years for a payment that's competitive
			with a conventional four-year loan. 
		<P>
			No up-front acquisition or lease end disposal fees: a Red Carpet Lease has
