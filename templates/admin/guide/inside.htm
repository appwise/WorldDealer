There is a simple, 12-step process for creating, editing and administering the dealer web site. Dealer information is preloaded in order to facilitate easy editing. Templates can be uploaded or changed with a click of a button. Here you will find step-by-step help to assist you in making administration changes. Please note that all screen shots are taken from the "Street Signs" artwork, and may not feature the same graphics as the template you choose.
<BR><BR>
After logging into the WorldDealer administration site, you are presented with a menu of the top-level options available to you as a site administrator. This guide focuses on the option labeled  "Maintain Dealer Webs."

<br><br>

<ul>
Adding HTML code to your Customizable Text areas allows you to add bolding, italics, and similar formatting options. A quick list of these codes (also called "tags") follows below.
<br><p>
To make a piece of text bold, type this tag immediately before the text you wish to have bold:  &lt;B&gt; Then, type this tag immediately after the text you want to be bolded:  &lt;/B&gt; . This will look like this when you put it in:

<br><p><ul>This is not bold &lt;B&gt;<b>This is bold</b>&lt;/B&gt; This is not bold.</ul>

<br>
Similarly, you can italicize portions of text by typing the &lt;I&gt; tag before it, and a &lt;/I&gt; tag after it. This will look like this when you put it in:
<br><p>
<ul>This is not in italics  &lt;I&gt;<i>This is in italics</i>&lt;/I&gt; but this is not in italics.</ul>
<br>
Also, you can change the color and size of text by typing the &lt;FONT&gt; tag before it, and the &lt;/FONT&gt; tag after it. To change the size of your text, the beginning tag would look like this: &lt;FONT SIZE="4"&gt;. This will make your text one size bigger than normal. 3 is the normal size for text, 1 is the smallest number allowable, and 7 is the largest. To make your text change color to red, use this tag: &lt;FONT COLOR="RED"&gt;. Other colors include black, white, yellow, and purple. Putting the size and color attributes would look like this:
<br><p>
<ul>this text is normal  &lt;FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="RED"&gt;<FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="red">this text is large (size 4) and red</FONT>&lt;/FONT&gt; but this is not.</ul>
<br><br>
Finally, to put an extra return in your text, use the &lt;BR&gt; tag. Insert this tag between lines that you want broken, as show below:
<br><p>
<ul>this text is on one line &lt;BR&gt;<BR>this text is on another line</ul>

<br><br>
<b>For quick reference:</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
	Bold: &lt;B&gt; and &lt;/B&gt;
	<br>
	Italics: &lt;I&gt; and &lt;/I&gt;
	<BR>
	Font Size and Color: &lt;FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="RED"&gt; and &lt;/FONT&gt;
	<BR>
	Line Break: &lt;BR&gt;
</ul>
